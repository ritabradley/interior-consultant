### How I approached this challenge

If you want to see a demo of my solution, you can find it [here](https://rb-interior-consultant.netlify.app/).

It took about a 6 hours in total to complete this project with the mobile navigation taking the longest to complete. The
main reason the mobile navigation took so long was because I coded it from scratch with pure CSS and no javaScript. I
used the `:checked` pseudo-class to toggle the menu open and closed.

I used flexbox to position the elements on the page and used floats for part of the navigation. I used the `:before` and
`:after` pseudo-classes to create the lines on the navigation. There's a slight animation when opening and closing the
menu to make it a less jarring experience. I feel like this project has helped me get a better grasp of how to use CSS
for things I would normally use JavaScript for. It's also given me the opportunity to practice more CSS in general. I
hope to before more comfortable with vanilla CSS over time and become less reliant on frameworks like Bootstrap or
TailwindCSS.
